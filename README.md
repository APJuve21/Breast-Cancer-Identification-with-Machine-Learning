# Breast-Cancer-Identification-with-Machine-Learning
Classification of malignant and benign tumors through 6 machine learning techniques on diagnostic breast cancer data supported by SHAP analysis

Approaches:

step 1) decision tree classifiers
step 2) random forests and gradient boosting machines
step 3) support vector classifiers (with linear and RBF kernels)
step 4) two-layer neural network with 40 nodes
step 5) post hoc analysis with SHAP and more
